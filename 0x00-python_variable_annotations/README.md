# 0x00-python_variable_annotations
## Overview
This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate the usage of variable annotations in Python. Variable annotations were introduced in Python 3.6 and provide a way to specify the type of variables in Python code. These annotations are primarily used for type hinting, improving code readability, and enabling static analysis tools to catch potential errors.
